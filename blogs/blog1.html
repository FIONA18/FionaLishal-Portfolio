            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Internet has grown to be an essential component of our lives in today's linked world. 
                The Internet has completely changed how we access information and communicate with one another, from surfing websites and streaming films to sending emails and connecting with individuals around the world. Have you ever thought about how this massive network truly functions, though? We'll look into the inner workings of the Internet in this blog and examine the interesting mechanisms that make it run so smoothly.</p>

            <h2>The World Wide Web (WWW)</h2>
            <p>
                The Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) are two different concepts, despite the fact that they are frequently used synonymously. The WWW is a system of linked documents and resources that can be accessed over the Internet, whereas the Internet is the world's network infrastructure. For retrieving and displaying web pages, the WWW uses technologies like Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and hyperlinks allow users to easily switch between different resources.

            <h2>Protocols and IP Addresses</h2>
            <p>
                The Internet uses a number of protocols to aid in device 
                communication. The most fundamental of them is the Internet 
                Protocol (IP), which gives each device linked to the network a 
                special address. Devices can find and communicate with one another, 
                thanks to IP addresses. Additionally, the reliable transmission of 
                data packets across the network is managed by protocols like TCP
                 (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).</p>

            <h2>Domain Name Server(DNS)</h2>
            <p>
                Despite the fact that IP addresses are necessary for device 
                communication, they are not user-friendly.
                 The Domain Name System (DNS) is used in this situation. DNS converts
                  domain names that can be read by humans (like www.example.com) into
                   the associated IP addresses. Your device can resolve domain names
                    and connect to the desired servers by querying DNS servers.</p>

            <h2>Packet Switching</h2>
            <p>
                A packet-switched network architecture underlies the operation of the Internet. Data is divided into tiny packets when sent over the Internet, and each packet includes both the data being sent and the essential addressing information. These packets move autonomously throughout the network, choosing several routes to get there. This decentralized strategy guarantees effective network resource utilization and robustness in the event of errors.
